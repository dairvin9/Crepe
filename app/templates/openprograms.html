								<p>Learn some things about your magical computer.
							</header>

							<p>
								It is possible to run programs from a python script. Using the <strong>Subprocess module</strong>. Check
								out this script:
							<br>
							<br>
								<pre>
										import subprocess
										subprocess.call('notepad.exe')
								</pre>
							<br>
								Running subprocess.call will execute the command in the parenthesis. If a file ends in .exe, that is a sign
								that the file is an executable file. So 'notepad.exe' is a command that will run the 'notepad.exe' file, which
								happens to open and run a program called notepad. How does Windows find the notepad program? There are certain
								folders in windows that are a part of your environment's 'path', and any program in here can be accessed without
								a full file path. You want to see your system's path, open a command prompt and type in "echo %PATH%". You will
								see that "C:\Windows" is in there- this folder contains notepad.exe, and is why your system has access to it,
								without typing in a full path name. You can add more folders to this path if you want. Anyway. "calc.exe" will
								open a calculator app.
							<br>
							<br>
								A fun* thing to do is to open up a bunch of windows for a computer. In python, you can write loops. Code inside
								the loop will be execued a bunch of times. Check it out:
							<pre>
								for x in range(0,5):
									print "wow such loop"
							</pre>
								The code inside the loop will be executed five times. Let me explain: unlike loops in cpp or java, this for loop
								does not actually count- it goes through a list. range(0,5) generates a list [0,1,2,3,4]. Thats right, it starts at
								0 and ends at 4, instead of going to five. The loop runs once for every element in the list, which is five times.
								This means you can write a script like:
							<pre>
								import subprocess
								for x in range(0,5):
									subprocess.call('calc.exe')
							</pre>
								And five calculators will appear on your screen! But maybe five isn't enough for you. You want more, you need more.
								And instead of calming down and asking yourself if this is a good thing to want, you set out to get it. So that brings
								us to the other kind of loop: the while loop. The while loop has similar syntax":
							<pre>
								import subprocess
								x = 0
								while x < 8:
									subprocess.call('calc.exe')
									x = x + 1
							</pre>
								In this case, the code inside the loop is run every time the expression in the "while" line evaluates to true. So as
								long as x < 8, a calculator will be open. Of course, this means you could put an expression that is always true in there-
								"Tacos" == "Tacos", 5 < 6, or even just the word True (True must be capitalized and not in quotes.) Congratulations! You
								are the proud creator of an infinite loop! Woo!
							<br>
							<br>
							<pre>
								import subprocess
								x = 0
								while True:
									subprocess.call('calc.exe')
									x = x + 1
							</pre>
							<br>
							<br>
								Now that you have this runaway train, you might want to think about derailing it. The best way to do that is crash your
								computer. Just kidding. All you have to do is kill the process that is creating all of the calculator instances. You can
								either right click the icon of your program in the taskbar at your computer and hit "close window" or open up task manager,
								right click your program, and hit "end task." All's good.
							<br>
							<br>

							Now, you have a script that can open a lot of programs. You have climbed the mountain!
