								<h2><a href="#">Desktop Backgrounds</a></h2>
								<p>The classic.</p>
							</header>

							<p>
								One of the classics. On most systems, it is possible to use a script to change the desktop background of
								your computer. For this, we only need the <strong>ctypes module</strong>, which you can look at here:
								<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html">"https://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html"</a>.
							<br>
							<br>
								This script is pretty simple. All that must be done is to import ctypes, feed the program the path to the
								image, and call a ctype method to set the background.
								<picture class=""></picture>
								<pre>
										import ctypes
										image_path="C:\\Users\\Me\\Documents\\GitHub\\raw scripts\\taylorSwiftFaceQuote.jpg"
										SPI_SETDESKWALLPAPER = 20
										ctypes.windll.user32.SystemParametersInfoA(SPI_SETDESKWALLPAPER, 0, image_path, 3)
								</pre>
							<br>
								It is the fourth line that makes the magic, but I want to explain the second line, the image path first. This line
								saves a string of the absolute path of the image to a variable. You have to give the absolute path- the relative path
								does not work here. A relative path is something that helps you find the file, based on your current directory. An absolute path
								works no matter where you start in the system. In windows, it usually starts with a drive letter. I am using my local disk drive,
								which default is the letter "c".  If the system cannot find an image at that path, it will (in Windows 10) sets a picture that
								is all black. In windows, the different folders are separated by the backslash "\" character. "I\Like\Toast.jpg" would
								be the path to a picture called Toast.jpg that is inside a folder called Like inside folder called I.
							<br>
							<br>
								In my code I have double backslashes, instead of these single backslashes. This is because of "escape sequences." In programming
								languages, strings are sequences of characters. They usually start with a quotation mark and end with a quotation mark. But what
								if, in your string, you wanted to include a quotation mark? You could use single quotes to denote the string (in python) and use
								double inside, but what if you want to use single and double? What if you wanted to include a newline character? What can be done?
								A bunch of people decided to make the backslash the escape character. So if you put a backslash before a quote mark, it will not
								end the string but be read as just a quote mark. There's a whole list of sequences: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h21280bw.aspx
								If you want to type a backslash, you have to escape it first. To a computer, "\\" is read as "\". So we do have our file path in there
								correctly! Woo!
							<br>
							<br>
								Now lets look at that fourth line:
								<pre>
									ctypes.windll.user32.SystemParametersInfoA(SPI_SETDESKWALLPAPER, 0, image_path, 3)
								</pre>
								This function takes four parameters.

							<!-- TODO: Fix this list -->
								<ol type="1">
									<li>The first parameter is</li>
									<li>This</li>
									<li>Obviously, this parameter is the path to the image you wish to set as your desktop background.</li>
									<li>This last number </li>
								</ol>
